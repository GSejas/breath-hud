Checklist of user requirements and coverage status

- [x] Read repository docs and source to produce artifacts
- [x] Produce ASCII art overview (see `architecture-ascii.md`)
- [x] Produce Mermaid diagrams for architecture and IPC/data flow (`architecture.mmd`, `data-flow.mmd`)
- [x] Produce an inline SVG illustrating breathing phases (`breathing-phases.svg`)
- [x] Store all artifacts under `docs/reports/` (this folder)

Requirements coverage:
- Read docs & analysis: Done
- ASCII art: Done
- Mermaid diagrams: Done
- Inline SVG: Done
- Tests or CI automation to build these diagrams: Deferred (can be added via Mermaid CLI or CI step)

Next steps (optional):
- Add a CI job that generates PNG/HTML previews from `.mmd` files.
- Create PNG exports of Mermaid diagrams and commit them for quick preview in GitHub.
- Expand data-flow diagrams to include timing and performance notes when moving engine logic to `main`.

Quality gates: no code changes were made; files added are documentation-only and safe.
